# CrateDB Demo Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration and usage of CrateDB with Python, showcasing data ingestion, querying, and analysis capabilities. The demo focuses on working with time-series data and implementing efficient data management practices.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- CrateDB instance
- Docker (optional, for local CrateDB deployment)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cratedb-demo.git
cd cratedb-demo
```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
poetry shell
```

4. Configure CrateDB connection:
- Update the connection settings in `src/config.py`
- Ensure CrateDB is running and accessible

## Key Features
- Database connection management with error handling
- Data ingestion examples
- Time-series data handling
- Query optimization demonstrations
- Data analysis examples using Jupyter notebooks

## Usage

### Basic Connection
```python
from src.connection import create_connection

conn = create_connection()
```

### Running Queries
```python
from src.utils import execute_query

result = execute_query(conn, "SELECT * FROM your_table LIMIT 5")
```

## Project Components

### Configuration (`src/config.py`)
Contains configuration settings for:
- Database connection parameters
- Logging settings
- Data paths

### Connection Management (`src/connection.py`)
Handles:
- Database connection establishment
- Connection pooling
- Error handling

### Utilities (`src/utils.py`)
Provides:
- Query execution helpers
- Data transformation functions
- Common database operations

## Development Tools

- **Poetry**: Dependency management and packaging
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality checks

### Running Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. To run them manually:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Create a Pull Request

## Data Sources
The project includes sample datasets for demonstration purposes. These datasets are stored in the `data/` directory and include:
- Time-series data
- Sample structured data
- Test datasets

## Running the Application

To start the application:

```bash
poetry run python main.py
```
